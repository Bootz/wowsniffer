1. What is wowsniffer?
Wowsniffer is a tool to sniff data sent and received by the World of Warcraft
client. It does this from inside the process, and as such is easily detectable
by Warden; so use at your own risk!

Wowsniffer is licensed under the MIT license, its source and latest version can
be obtained at: https://github.com/ccshiro/wowsniffer

Also, huge thanks to Tsuda Kageyu for writing the MinHook library, which this
software makes use of, and to RaMMicHaeL for maintaining and improving MinHook.
You can check out MinHook at: https://github.com/RaMMicHaeL/minhook

2. Requirements
Visual Studio Express (could potentially work with other compilers with some
                       tweaking, which I might get around to eventually).
CMake

3. Installation
Do the following:
	1. Launch cmd.exe and point it to your intended build directory. I have my
	   setup looking like this:
	   ./wowsniffer/         # this is the source directory
	   ./wowsniffer_build/   # build directory
	   ./wowsniffer_install/ # install directory
	2. Type "cmake --help" to see the generators available to you.
	3. Pick one appropriate for you, make sure you get the architecture correct.
	   Let's say we chose "Visual Studio 11 Win64".
	4. Run the following command, adjusting the input according to your needs:
	   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../wowsniffer_install/ -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" ../wowsniffer/
	5. Open the generated solution file; build and install. The binaries will
	   be placed in ./wowsniffer_install/

4. Usage
Open cmd.exe and point it to the directory where wowsniffer.exe is. Invoke
wowsniffer.exe as shown below to print the proper usage of the program:

wowsniffer --help

Make sure your World of Warcraft client is the same architecture as you compiled
against.

TIP: You can redirect stdout to dump the output to a file instead of your
console. For example:

wowsniffer 1500 > "dump.txt"
